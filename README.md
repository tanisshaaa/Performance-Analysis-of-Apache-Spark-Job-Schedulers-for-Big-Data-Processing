# Performance-Analysis-of-Apache-Spark-Job-Schedulers-for-Big-Data-Processing

## Overview  
With the explosive growth of big data in both academia and industry, efficient large-scale data processing has become crucial. Apache Spark stands out as a state-of-the-art distributed computing framework due to its fault tolerance, scalability, and high-performance in-memory processing.  

This repository presents a performance analysis of various Apache Spark job schedulers, including:  
- **Earliest Available (EA)**  
- **Non-violation scenarios**  
- **Average turnaround time**  
- **Average waiting time**  

By benchmarking these schedulers under diverse big-data workloads, we evaluate their impact on job latency, resource efficiency, and system throughput. The findings from this study provide insights into optimizing job scheduling strategies in Apache Spark environments, with potential applications in future big data processing.  

## Features  
- **Comparative analysis** of multiple job schedulers in Apache Spark  
- **Benchmarking performance** under various workloads  
- **Evaluation of key metrics**, including job latency, resource utilization, and system throughput  
- **Insights into optimizing job scheduling** for large-scale data processing  

## Technologies Used  
- Apache Spark  
- Big Data Processing Frameworks  
- Distributed Computing
